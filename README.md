#Online Auction System with Bidding and Seller Management

I Create an online auction system in Java where users can place bids on
listed items, view bid histories, and manage personal auction items. Sellers should be able to
list items, set starting prices, and manage auctions. Admins can monitor listings, approve new
sellers, and generate reports on auction outcomes. The system should support automatic
bidding, notifications for outbid alerts, and auction end timers. Use Java concepts like classes,
inheritance, interfaces, exception handling, collections, and JDBC.
